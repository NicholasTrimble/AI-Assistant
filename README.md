This is a personal project I built to learn how to create a coding assistant that runs entirely on my computer. The AI Dev Assistant lets me ask questions about my code and get helpful responses, including nicely formatted code examples. It has a dark, clean chat interface with separate user and AI messages and shows when the AI is thinking. Everything works offline, so I can use it anytime without needing the internet.

The frontend is built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it talks to a local AI model that runs on my machine. Using this project, I learned how to connect a frontend to a local AI, handle chat interactions, and make code responses easy to read and use. I also explored creating a lightweight tool that can be run on different devices. In the future, I plan to make it even smoother, add better code formatting, and improve the interface so it feels more like a professional coding assistant.
